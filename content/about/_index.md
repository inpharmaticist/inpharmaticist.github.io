> Bitcoin is different things to different people. <br />
> â€” Jameson Lopp

Whatever Bitcoin is to you and wherever you are in your Bitcoin journey, the San Diego Bitcoiners are here for you! Born out of the Covid pandemic at a time when Bitcoiners needed to get back to rubbing elbows, this meetup set out to serve as a means to gather folks who were interested in talking and learning about Bitcoin, and _only_ Bitcoin! We currently meet the second Thursday of the month at [Quantum Brewing](https://www.quantumbrewingsd.com/) in Kearny Mesa. We have guest presentations, short demos, and sometimes just hang out and chat with each other.
